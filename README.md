# CryptoCredit Backend API

CryptoCredit Backend is a FastAPI powered service that calculates a transparent and trustable **crypto credit score** by aggregating on chain user data.

The protocol enables decentralized accountability, empowering fairer financial decisions across the Web3 ecosystem.

Below is a breakdown of all the parameters currently considered in generating the **Crypto Credit Score**. These factors combine to form a transparent, trustable score that reflects on chain behavior.

---

## **1. Wallet & Account Parameters**

* **Wallet Age** â€“ Time since the first recorded on chain transaction.
* **Number of Active Wallets** â€“ Count of wallets linked to the user.
* **Wallet Verification Status** â€“ Whether the wallet is verified by the user.

## **2. Transaction History**

* **Total Transaction Count** â€“ All transactions across supported chains.
* **Transaction Volume (Native & USD)** â€“ Total transferred value.
* **Average Transaction Value** â€“ Mean value per transaction.
* **Frequency of Transactions** â€“ Weekly/monthly activity levels.
* **Incoming vs Outgoing Ratio** â€“ Balance of inflow vs outflow.
* **Stablecoin Transactions** â€“ Share of transactions in stablecoins.

## **3. Staking Habits**

* **Total Assets Staked** â€“ Amount of assets locked in staking.
* **Staking Duration** â€“ How long assets remain staked.
* **Number of Staking Contracts** â€“ Diversity of staking sources.
* **Rewards Earned** â€“ Yield or rewards generated via staking.

## **4. DeFi Interactions**

* **Number of Protocols Used** â€“ Unique DeFi protocols interacted with.
* **Liquidity Pool Contributions** â€“ Assets provided to LPs.
* **Yield Farming Participation** â€“ Frequency & scale of farming activities.
* **Borrowing & Lending History** â€“ Usage of decentralized lending platforms.

## **5. Token Portfolio Insights**

* **Token Diversity** â€“ Number of unique tokens held.
* **Blue chip vs. High risk Ratio** â€“ Quality assessment of holdings.
* **Portfolio Volatility** â€“ Value fluctuations over time.

## **6. Risk Indicators**

* **Rug Pull Exposure** â€“ Past interactions with suspicious projects.
* **High gas Transactions** â€“ Frequency of transactions with unusually high gas.
* **Contract Approval Count** â€“ Number of active token approvals.

## **7. Reputation & Engagement**

* **NFT Ownership & Activity** â€“ Number and type of NFTs owned.

##### All parameters are normalized and weighted according to the scoring model, which outputs a final score between 0 and 900.

## Features

* **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, refresh, and revoke tokens.
* **Chain Management**: Retrieve supported blockchain networks (76).
* **Wallet Tracking**: Add, verify, list, and delete wallets.
* **Scoring Engine**: Compute a 0 900 crypto credit score based on aggregated behavior.
* **RESTful API**: Fully documented OpenAPI spec.

## Authentication

The API uses **JWT Bearer tokens** for secure access.

To authorize, click the **Authorize** button in the API docs or send an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header with your requests.
